wjm 18-apr-1999: Almost finalized PK2K kits (Vs3100-like SCSI support
		for VAXstation 2000 & microVAX 2000) for various flavors 
		of OpenVMS VAX. Packaging to be improved at some later date.
wjm 10-may-1999: All kits successfully tested (except for the STABACKIT part,
		which I might well never use). Consider the files "frozen".
wjm 06-jul-1999: Kits added for oVMS V7.2 (DIF & SRC identical to V7.1).

   ... NOTE: PK2K is as "unsupported" as can be ... 
   ... but highly likely to just work fine, for you as it does for me ...

	PK2K_0013-BIN.ZIP	Binaries for VMS V5.5-2, plus the README
				(slight update from the 0012 version).

        PK2K_0013-BIN.README	(ASCII!) Usage notes for the V5.5-2 version.
				Applies equally well to the following kits,
				with the respective VMS version substituted
				for "V5.5-2".

	PK2K_0013-061BIN.ZIP	Binaries for oVMS V6.1

	PK2K_0013-062BIN.ZIP	Binaries for oVMS V6.2

	PK2K_0013-071BIN.ZIP	Binaries for oVMS V7.1

	PK2K_0013-072BIN.ZIP	Binaries for oVMS V7.2 (NEW!)

	PK2K-BOOT_0013.ZIP	"Secondary VMB" SYSBOOT images for booting into
				a SCSI disk, to be loaded via DUAn: or ESA0:

	KA410W_V23_ROM-0013.PATCH
				(ASCII!) PATCH command file for improving
				upon the "KA410-B V2.3" ROM, allowing it
				to boot from SCSI disks, instead of "MUA0".
				The bootstrap code within is identical 
				to the one in PK2K-BOOT_0013.ZIP .

   ... NOTE: PK2K is as "unsupported" as can be ... 
   ... but highly likely to just work fine, for you as it does for me ...
